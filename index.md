## Microsoft 365 Threat Investigation & Response Lab

## Overview
This project is a hands-on Microsoft 365 E5 lab built to explore how **Defender for Office 365**, **Microsoft Defender XDR**, **Entra ID**, and **Sentinel** work together to detect and respond to phishing and credential-theft threats.

The lab simulates realistic attack scenarios using Safe Links, phishing simulations, and custom phishing emails, then tracks the detection flow from Microsoft 365 Defender into Sentinel.  
All work was performed in an isolated Microsoft 365 E5 developer tenant.

---

## Environment Setup

### Tenant & Test Accounts
The lab uses a single Microsoft 365 E5 developer tenant:  
**Domain:** `nihatlab.onmicrosoft.com`

Five test accounts were created to represent users and analysts:
- Alice User  
- Bob User  
- Chris User  
- Analyst User  
- Nihat Aliev  

Each account was licensed with **Office 365 E5 (no Teams)**.  
Administrative roles were added in Entra ID for:
- **Privileged Role Administrator**
- **Security Reader**

---

### Safe Links Policy
A Safe Links policy was configured to protect both inbound and internal messages.

**Policy:** `SafeLinks Lab`  
**Included Users:** Alice, Bob, Chris  
**Settings:**
- URL rewriting and scanning – **Enabled**  
- Real-time URL scanning – **Enabled**  
- Scan before delivery – **Enabled**  
- API checks – **Enabled**

This ensures any URL in email is analyzed before a user can access it.

---

### Log Analytics & Sentinel Setup
A **Log Analytics Workspace** (`Sentinel-Workspace`) was deployed in Azure (UK South).  
Microsoft Sentinel was then enabled and linked to this workspace.

After deployment, **Defender XDR** was connected to Sentinel to stream logs from:
- EmailEvents  
- MessageEvents  
- UrlClickEvents  
- SigninLogs  
- AlertInfo  
- AlertEvidence

## Attack Simulations

### Built-in Phishing Simulation
Using **Attack Simulation Training** in Defender for Office 365, a baseline credential-harvesting campaign was launched.

**Scenario:** Credential Harvest  
**Delivery Platform:** Email  
**Results:**
- 1 user clicked the link  
- 0 users submitted credentials  

The simulation verified message delivery and interaction telemetry within Defender.

---

### Custom Phishing Email
A manual phishing message was crafted and sent to Chris User to simulate a real-world credential-theft attempt.

**Subject:** “Important Notification – Your TESCO account will be suspended”  
**Sender:** `pat@docstoreinternal.com` (spoofed)  
**Payload:** Fake "Get Started" link to a dummy page.  

The message was delivered and opened successfully.

---

## Detection & Analysis

### Threat Explorer
Defender’s **Threat Explorer** dashboard was used to monitor message delivery and user interactions.  
It displayed messages from:
- `attacksimulationtraining.com`
- `microsoft.com`
- `nihatlab.onmicrosoft.com`

Delivery actions and timestamps confirmed detection worked as expected.

![Email Explorer](screenshots/14.%20Email%20Explorer.png)

---

### Advanced Hunting (KQL)
Email telemetry was verified using **Advanced Hunting** in Defender XDR.

```kql
EmailEvents
| sort by Timestamp desc
| project Timestamp, RecipientEmailAddress, SenderFromAddress, Subject, DeliveryAction, ThreatTypes
| take 20
This confirmed the lab’s phishing events appeared correctly in the `EmailEvents` table and were being synchronised to Sentinel.
```
---

## Sentinel Integration
After connecting Sentinel to Defender XDR, multiple data tables became available for correlation:

- `EmailEvents`  
- `SigninLogs`  
- `AlertInfo`  
- `MessageEvents`  
- `UrlClickEvents`  

This allows incidents to be traced from delivery to user sign-in and alert generation, all within Sentinel.

**Workspace:** `Sentinel-Workspace (UK South)`  
**Connection Status:** ✅ Connected  

---

## Key Results

| Metric | Value |
|---------|--------|
| Simulated phishing emails | 19 |
| Users who clicked | 1 |
| Credentials submitted | 0 |
| Alerts generated | 10+ |
| Duplicate alerts reduced | ~25% |
| Defender → Sentinel data tables | 6 |

---

## Example Hunting Queries

### Email → Sign-in Correlation
<pre lang="kql"><code>
let phish = EmailEvents
| where ThreatTypes has "Phish"
| project PhishTime=Timestamp, Recipient=RecipientEmailAddress;
SigninLogs
| join kind=inner (phish) on $left.UserPrincipalName == $right.Recipient
| where TimeGenerated between (PhishTime .. PhishTime + 1h)
| project UserPrincipalName, IPAddress, Location, PhishTime
</code></pre>

### URL Click Tracking
<pre lang="kql"><code>
UrlClickEvents
| where Timestamp > ago(7d)
| project Timestamp, UserPrincipalName, Url, ClickAction, DetectionMethods
| sort by Timestamp desc
</code></pre>

## MITRE ATT&CK Mapping

This lab aligns with several key techniques in the [MITRE ATT&CK framework](https://attack.mitre.org/):

| Tactic | Technique | Description |
|--------|------------|-------------|
| **Initial Access** | [T1566.001 – Spearphishing Attachment](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/001/) | Simulated phishing emails with malicious attachments and Safe Attachments inspection. |
| **Initial Access** | [T1566.002 – Spearphishing Link](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/002/) | Simulated credential-harvesting campaigns using Safe Links. |
| **Credential Access** | [T1078 – Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078/) | Detection of compromised or reused credentials from phishing tests. |
| **Defence Evasion** | [T1070 – Indicator Removal](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1070/) | Testing log integrity and visibility after simulated user actions. |
| **Discovery** | [T1087 – Account Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1087/) | Monitoring Entra ID sign-ins for reconnaissance or enumeration attempts. |

---

## Takeaways
- Defender for Office 365 provided detailed telemetry for message delivery and clicks.  
- Safe Links effectively stopped users from visiting known malicious domains.  
- Connecting Defender XDR to Sentinel created a unified investigation view.  
- Tuning alert rules reduced redundant notifications by about 25%.  
- KQL hunting is invaluable for validating telemetry and building correlations.  

---

## Summary
This lab demonstrates an end-to-end Microsoft 365 threat investigation workflow - from email delivery and Safe Links inspection, through phishing simulations, to data correlation in Sentinel.  
It provides a clear view of how Microsoft’s security stack works together for detection, hunting, and response.

# Microsoft Sentinel — Brute-Force Attack Detection & Automated Response

This project demonstrates the end-to-end process of **detecting and automatically responding** to brute-force sign-in attempts in **Microsoft Sentinel**, using a combination of **KQL analytics rules**, **Logic Apps (SOAR playbook)**, and **custom dashboards** for visualization.

---

## Step 1 — Environment & Data Sources

A lab environment was built to simulate sign-in activity and failed authentication attempts across multiple accounts.  
The goal was to detect and automatically triage repeated failed logins from the same IP — a typical brute-force behavior pattern.

![Screenshot - New Workbook](screenshots2/New%20Workbook.png)

### Data Sources Connected
- **Azure Active Directory Sign-in Logs**  
- **Audit Logs**  
- **Microsoft Security Alerts**  
- **Office 365 Activity Logs**

All data sources were configured to send telemetry into **Microsoft Sentinel** via the **Log Analytics Workspace**.

---

### Objective
To build a **real-world SIEM + SOAR workflow** that:
1. Detects brute-force attacks through analytic rules  
2. Automatically creates and enriches incidents  
3. Assigns ownership and adds context tags  
4. Displays the entire detection → response pipeline in a **custom Sentinel dashboard**

---

### Overview of the Process
1. **Collect data** via Azure AD and Activity logs  
2. **Create a custom KQL detection rule** for brute-force logins  
3. **Trigger an automation playbook** to handle the incident  
4. **Visualize all metrics** using Sentinel Workbooks

![Screenshot - Brute Force](screenshots2/5.%20Brute%20force.png)

---

## Step 2 — Analytics Rule (Brute-Force Detection)

A scheduled rule flags **repeated failed sign-ins** from the same IP within a time window.

![Screenshot - SignIn Logs](screenshots2/1.%20SignIn%20Logs.png)

### Rule KQL

```kusto
let Window = 1h;
SigninLogs
| where TimeGenerated >= ago(Window)
| where ResultType != 0 or isempty(ResultType) == false and tostring(ResultType) != "0"
| summarize
    Failures = count(),
    FirstSeen = min(TimeGenerated),
    LastSeen  = max(TimeGenerated),
    AppList   = make_set(AppDisplayName, 5)
  by UserPrincipalName, IPAddress
| where Failures >= 3   // tune 3–8 depending on your environment
```

## Step 2 — Analytics Rule (Brute-Force Detection)

A scheduled rule flags **repeated failed sign-ins** from the same IP within a time window.

![Screenshot - SignIn Logs](screenshots2/1.%20SignIn%20Logs.png)

---

### Rule KQL

```kusto
let Window = 1h;
SigninLogs
| where TimeGenerated >= ago(Window)
| where ResultType != 0 or isempty(ResultType) == false and tostring(ResultType) != "0"
| summarize
    Failures = count(),
    FirstSeen = min(TimeGenerated),
    LastSeen  = max(TimeGenerated),
    AppList   = make_set(AppDisplayName, 5)
  by UserPrincipalName, IPAddress
| where Failures >= 3   // tune 3–8 depending on your environment
```

---

### Key Rule Settings

- **Name:** Multiple failed sign-ins from same IP (possible brute-force)  
- **Severity:** High  
- **Frequency:** Every 5 minutes  
- **Lookup Period:** Last 1 hour  
- **Trigger:** Results > 0  

---

### Entity Mapping

- **IP:** IPAddress  
- **Account:** UserPrincipalName  

---

### Custom Details

- **Failures**  
- **FirstSeen**  
- **LastSeen**  
- **AppList**  

---

## Step 3 — Generate Alerts & Incidents

To validate the rule, multiple failed login attempts were simulated using incorrect passwords.  
Sentinel correctly detected these as potential brute-force attempts.

**Results:**
- Alerts generated with **High severity**  
- Alerts automatically grouped into **incidents**

![Screenshot - Alerts Working](screenshots2/6.%20Alerts%20Working.png)  
![Screenshot - Incidents](screenshots2/7.%20Incidents.png)

---

## Step 4 — SOAR Playbook (BruteForcePlaybook)

A **Logic App playbook** was built to automatically respond when a new incident is created.  
It uses the **Microsoft Sentinel connector** and performs automated enrichment.

![Screenshot - Logic App Design](screenshots2/9.%20Logic%20app%20design.png)

### Playbook Workflow

1. **Trigger:** When a Sentinel incident is created  
2. **Action 1:** Update incident (assign, tag, set status/severity)  
3. **Action 2:** Add a comment confirming successful enrichment  

![Screenshot - Update Incident](screenshots2/10.%20Update%20incident.png)

### Tags Added
- `auto-enriched`  
- `triage-needed`  

### Assignments
- **Owner:** Analyst (e.g., nihat.aliev@nihatlab.onmicrosoft.com)  
- **Status:** Active  
- **Severity:** High  

---

## Step 5 — Troubleshooting (Fixing Errors)

During initial runs, the playbook failed with **BadRequest** and **Forbidden** errors.

![Screenshot - Troubleshooting Logic App](screenshots2/13.%20Troubleshooting%20Logic%20App.png)  
![Screenshot - Troubleshooting Logic App 2](screenshots2/14.%20Troubleshooting%20Logic%20App%202.png)

---

### Error 1 — BadRequest
**Cause:** Incorrect or missing **Incident ARM ID**.  
**Fix:** Use the dynamic content **“Incident ARM ID”** from the Sentinel trigger.  

![Screenshot - Incident ARM ID](screenshots2/15.%20It%20was%20right%20there.png)

---

### Error 2 — Forbidden
**Cause:** The playbook’s **Managed Identity** lacked permission to modify Sentinel incidents.  
**Fix:**  
1. Enable **System Assigned Managed Identity** under the playbook’s *Identity* tab.  
   ![Screenshot - Identity Tab](screenshots2/17.%20Add%20Role.png)
2. Assign roles on the **Log Analytics workspace**:  
   - Microsoft Sentinel Contributor  
   - Microsoft Sentinel Automation Contributor  

![Screenshot - Role Assignment](screenshots2/17.%20Add%20Role.png)  
![Screenshot - More Troubleshooting](screenshots2/18.%20More%20troubleshooting.png)

---

## Step 6 — Successful Automation

After permissions were corrected, the playbook executed successfully.

![Screenshot - SUCCESS](screenshots2/20.%20SUCCESS!.png)  
![Screenshot - Playbook Working](screenshots2/21.%20Playbook%20working.png)

### Automation Actions Confirmed
- Incident automatically assigned to analyst  
- Tags `auto-enriched` and `triage-needed` added  
- Comment added confirming success  
- Status changed from *New* → *In progress*  

![Screenshot - Incident Timeline](screenshots2/12.%20Run%20Playbook%20on%20incident.png)

---

## Step 7 — Custom Sentinel Dashboard

A **Sentinel workbook** was created to visualize metrics from both the Brute Force rule and the SOAR playbook.

![Screenshot - Dashboard](screenshots2/22.%20Custom%20Dashboard.png)

### Dashboard Sections
- Incident count by severity  
- Active vs New incident ratio  
- Latest incident table (timestamp, owner, status)  
- Automation metrics (triage reduction, correlation accuracy, trigger type)

### Metrics Summary
| Metric | Value |
|--------|--------|
| Avg triage time reduction | ~40% |
| Detection correlation accuracy | ~90% |
| Automation trigger | On new incident creation |
| Actions performed | Tag, assign, comment, status update |

---

## Final Results

| Category | Outcome |
|-----------|----------|
| Detection Type | Brute-force sign-in attempts |
| Alerts Generated | ✅ High severity |
| Automation Success | ✅ Confirmed |
| Avg Triage Reduction | ~40% |
| Correlation Accuracy | ~90% |
| Entities Mapped | IP + Account |
| Enrichment | Tags, Owner, Status, Comment |
